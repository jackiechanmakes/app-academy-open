# App Academy Open

App Academy Open is identical to App Academy's in-person full-time full-stack software engineering curriculum in terms of content. It covers ~2000 hours of materials, ranging in topics such as data structures and algorithms, design patterns, scalability, OOP, TDD, computational complexity, and software engineering best practices. Programming languages and technologies include JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Git, Node.js, Express, SQL, React-Redux, Flask, Python, and Docker. 

This repository holds all of my solutions to the coding exercises and projects from the curriculum.

## FAQ
- How is the free App Academy Open course different from the paid App Academy course? 

The course content is identical. The paid course gives you the option to work through the material in-person on a set schedule with guidance from teaching assistants, while the free course is self-paced and relies on your self-discipline to complete the curriculum well. 

- Why did you choose App Academy Open instead of the paid version? 

I am autodidactic and have a learner's heart by nature, so I'm well-versed in learning on my own. This makes the biggest con of lacking guidance from teaching assistants with the free course a non-issue for me. I actually feel struggling through the material on my own has helped me understand the material better with more chances to practice. I know I would've greatly benefitted from being around teachers and peers in-person; however, I ultimately didn't have the financial nor scheduling means to sign up for the paid course but still wanted to learn so I just went for it. I am grateful App Academy has opened up all of their course materials for people in similar situations as mine.

- Did you get help? 

I worked on and solved all coding exercises on my own...with lots of Googling unfamilar concepts and bugs of course! At times after completing the exercises and projects by myself, I would ask software engineering friends for feedback and best practices if I thought it would move the needle in learning. 

- What does this repository contain? 

My solutions to all of App Academy's coding exercises and project challenges. I did not skip reading, watching, or practicing any of the course material modules. 

- What is your background? 

I graduated from Caltech with honors with a B.S. in Chemical Engineering (Process Systems). I've also earned a Software Engineering Certificate with honors from UCSC.

- Where are your personal projects? 
They are in other repositories. Check them out if you have a moment!

- Would you recommend App Academy Open? 

Yes! I've learned so much. Because it can get overwhelming with the amount of material available to learn, I recommend the paid version if you can afford it so you can save time by having people in-person to help when you're struggling; however, if you're self-motivated, driven, and persistent, it is entirely possible to complete the curriculum on your own.
