        <p>
            I am not a doctor, therapist, or any type of licensed medical clinician so please take everything I say with a grain of salt. I am just a patient with the experience of being one for close to a decade. I have struggled with finding resources to support my healing when I’ve really needed it. Doctors, therapists, nurses, medical administrators, healthcare insurance agents, and lawyers just don’t seem to fully get what it’s like being all the way on the other side of the room in pain. There also aren’t as many supportive resources available from the perspective of a patient because patients have only so much bandwidth given their medical condition and generally don’t want to revisit their trauma. Because of this, I’ve decided to share what I learned to navigate the healthcare and legal systems in the U.S. to optimize healing so other patients don’t have to learn it the hard way like I did.

            Having stated my intentions for creating this resource, please <a href="contact.html">leave me feedback</a> if something I say doesn’t land correctly for you and I will take that into account to better this space for anyone who passes by.
