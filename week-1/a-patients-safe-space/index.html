        <h2>Medical Journey</h2>
        <p>
            I have been a chronic pain patient for a while now, but I’m excited to announce that I’m about to leave that role because I’m healed. It’s been a long medical journey. Despite my impressive work ethic and grit, I find it extremely difficult to be a patient within the constraints of the U.S. healthcare and legal system. Understanding how tough it is to be a patient, I am creating a safe space to support anyone else who finds themselves in a similar situation, specifically one in which there’s enough reason to continue to work towards healing.
        </p>

        <p>
            Here are generalized lessons I learned along the way that truly benefitted me when healing. However, I understand everyone’s medical condition is unique to them and I don’t want to discourage or isolate anyone so please, <i><b>please</b></i> ignore anything that might not be productive for you. You know best and this is just what worked for me and my condition, but I genuinely hope something I put out into the world brings you some semblance of comfort.
        </p>

        <h2>Lessons on Healing Related to You</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>Your mindset matters.</strong> You are the owner of your pain; no one else. You have the ability to heal! Repeat it a few more times until you believe it. It’s completely understandable how scary being in pain is and natural even to want to jump to worst-case scenarios, but believing that you have the ability to control your life sets your brain up to build neural connections that will encourage healing.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Be careful of who you listen to (even me!).</strong> Your body wants and needs to feel safe to heal. Ignore all the “you’re not going to get any better”, “what you’re trying to do is so hard”, “it’s impossible,” etc. You don’t need the added threat to your body.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Be patient.</strong> Don’t rush the process. Nudge the edges of pain with graded exposure to activity. Don’t avoid the pain so your progress is stagnant but also don’t try to aggressively break through it and cause big flare-ups in your body. Your body wants to heal and it’ll do so gently.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Treat yourself</strong> to something that <a href="practice.html">makes your body feel better</a>, particularly on bad days. Treat yourself to the good, tasty food you’ve been craving. Immerse yourself in the tranquility of nature. Take a hot bath. Self-care is vital for your body to feel good and break pain patterns.

            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Take breaks.</strong> Don’t blame or be so hard on yourself on days that you feel bad or aren’t as productive. You’re in pain; it’s understandable why you’d feel bad. Instead, rest. Rest harder. Stay in bed all day if you can. You can do no wrong.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Lessons on Healing Related to Others</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>Be kind to those who are trying to help, if you can.</strong> You hurt. Sometimes it’s easier to give in to the suffering of your pain and lash out at anyone and everyone so they can finally understand how you feel on the inside. But try not to. They’re people too and they’re choosing to support you. People are also much more likely to help you heal when you’re kind to them. If you can’t though, forgive yourself because pain really hurts. It’s so much easier to give kindness when you’re not feeling awful and just holding on to survive.
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Accept quickly that most people won’t be there for you, but look for the ones who will.</strong> There will be a lot of opportunities to be disappointed by your community. More than you can imagine from people you trust. Fight hard not to be jaded so you don’t close yourself off to people you didn’t expect to bring light and healing into your life.
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Choose your doctors/therapists <i>extremely</i> carefully.</strong> Their role is to empower your healing. Anything definitively less and they need to be cut out of your healing journey as soon as possible.
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Give your medical providers space to make mistakes and be brave enough to give them feedback when they do.</strong> If your doctor or therapist can’t handle constructive feedback and make reasonable changes with what doesn’t work for you in mind, it’s time to rethink the importance of your relationship.
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Say no to your medical providers</strong> whenever it doesn’t feel right. Trust your gut. Bad vibes is enough to say no; you don’t need to wait until something is without a doubt bad to happen. If necessary, remember that other doctors or therapists exist in the world that may be a better fit for you. Cut out anyone, particularly from your medical care team, who you strongly feel:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Doesn’t care about you
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Dismisses your pain
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Pathologizes your pain
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                They focus on what’s wrong with <i><b>you</b></i> instead of their treatment protocols for you. The focus should be on providing you with as many options as possible to promote healing.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>

        </ol>
        <p><strong>I hope you feel a lot better soon! You got this.</strong></p>
