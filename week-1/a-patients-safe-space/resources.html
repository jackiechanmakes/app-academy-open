            Here are external resources that helped retrain my brain to feel safe in my body so I could heal:

                <li>Check out their book, <a href="https://www.noigroup.com/product/explain-pain-second-edition/">Explain Pain</a>, which demystifies pain. Research shows that the more you understand pain, the less it'll hurt.</li>

                <li>Bessel van der Kolk is a psychiatrist, author, researcher, and educator.</li>
                <li>His research focuses on how trauma impacts neurobiology, development, and attachment. van der Kolk believes that lasting healing only happens when it is safe for trauma victims to inhabit their bodies, and to tolerate feeling what they feel, and knowing what they know. This may involve trauma processing, neurofeedback, theater, meditation, play, and yoga.</li>
            </ul>
